# E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation
The project aims to analyze the existing customer data and gather valuable insights about the purchase pattern. The goal is to find the most buying brands or most search brands based on given data by using K - Means clustering algorithm.

## ABSTRACT:

-> Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviours, so you can market to those customers more effectively. 

-> In comparison to customer segmentation, market segmentation is more general and looks at all of the marketplace. Whereas market segmentation relates to the whole market, customer segmentation is your part of the market.

-> A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

-> Given the e-commerce data (Cust_ID, Gender, Orders), use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest.
-> Variable Description:
       Cust_ID - Unique numbering for customers
       Gender - Gender of the customer
       Orders - Number of orders placed by each customer in the past

## SCOPE:

● Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights about the purchase pattern.

● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment.

● Segmenting customer based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’) with the help of silhouette score.
